## 🧮 Task 1: Basic Even Odd Check Program

### Description
A simple Python Program to Test Whether a number is odd or even. We will test one user-input number.

### Features
- Odd Even Comparison 

### Usage
```bash
python evenOdd.py

```
### Example Output

Enter a Number: 25

25 is an odd Number


## 👋 Task 2: Sum Range of Numbers (1 to 50)
### Description
This Program Calculates the Sum of 50 Numbers starting form to 50, Or As extra a series of Number from start to End Specified by User.

### Features
- Calculate the Sum of Number in Series from Start to End Specified by User.


### Usage
```bash
python sum50s.py
```

### Example Output

Enter Starting Number 0 or more: 1

Enter Last Number to Calculate: 50

The sum of Numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275

## 👋 Task 3: Calculate Factorial of Given Number
### Description
This Program Calculates the Factorial using Recursion of the input number Specified by User.

### Features
- Calculate the Factorial of Number Specified by User with Recursion method.


### Usage
```bash
python factorial.py
```

### Example Output

Enter a Number: 10

Factorial of 10 is 3628800

## 👋 Task 4: Modules in Python- Use of Math Module
### Description
This Program Shows the usage of Modules in Python Program. We specifically use The Math Module for This Demonstration. 

### Features
- Import Math Module in Python Program
- Use it To Calculate Square Root of User Input Number
- Use Math Module to Calculate Natural Log of User Input Number.
- Finally Use Math Module to calculate Sine Value of User input number in radian. 


### Usage
```bash
python mathModule.py
```

### Example Output

Enter a Number: 20

Square Root of 20 is 4.47213595499958

Natural log of 20 is 2.995732273553991

Sine value of 20 is 0.9129452507276277
